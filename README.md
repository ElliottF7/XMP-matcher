# XMP-matcher
## This throwaway script matches the filename of an XMP sidecar file with its associated image or movie file and moves the XMP file into the appropriate folder based on where the match is found.

This script assumes that all of the XMP files are within one folder and all the other content files are within folders based on their month and year

For example a picture taken in June of 2019 would be placed into "rootFolder/2019/06/" and the XMP file with the matching name for this content file would then be placed in this folder.
